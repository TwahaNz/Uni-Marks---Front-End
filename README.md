# Uni-Marks---Front-End
Student are always eager to find out their results the moment they complete writing theit exam or test. I decided to write this program to help students see the results on the go when they need to.

***************** NOTE APP IS CURRENTLY ONLY FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPING STUDENTS IN 3RD YEAR ******************

## Description
Students will be able to register on the site and get to see all the subject results that have been published during the year.
Students will also be able to have profiles so that can change their password.

##Future Plans
I will be adding a lecture's account section where lectures can upload marks and students will be able to get notifications that marks have been uploaded

A section will be created where students can comment on the marks they received.
